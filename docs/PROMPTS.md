Now I want you to give recommended initial values (or ranges) for various parameters, that are not strictly specified in the book that describes the model. These are:
* Initial net worth of firms (`A`)
* Initial production of firms (`Y`)
* Initial wage (`w`) for each firm and initial minimum wage (`ŵ`) (will these be the same?)
* Initial base price for each firm (`P`)
* Initial equity base of banks (`E`)
* Capital requirement coefficient (`v`)
* Baseline interest rate (one that the central bank would set if it existed) (`r_bar`)
* Propensity to consume parameter (`beta`) where => (```π_i  = 1 / (1 + tanh(savings_i / avg_savings) ** beta)```)
* Dividend payout ratio (`delta`)

I guess that these would need to be calibrated with a Monte Carlo simulation or sth like that?
