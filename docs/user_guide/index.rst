User Guide
==========

This guide walks you through using BAM Engine — from understanding the underlying
economic model to writing your own extensions and validating results against the
reference literature.

Whether you're new to agent-based modeling or an experienced researcher, the guide
is organized in progressive order: start with the conceptual foundations, learn the
core API, then move to advanced customization and validation workflows.
