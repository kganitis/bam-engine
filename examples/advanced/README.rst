=================

Examples showing advanced features like custom events, roles, relationships,
and pipeline configuration.

These examples demonstrate:

* Creating custom events to extend the model
* Defining custom roles to add new agent behaviors
* Creating many-to-many relationships between roles with edge data
* Modifying the event execution pipeline
* Running parameter sweeps and ensemble simulations
* Advanced data collection and analysis techniques
