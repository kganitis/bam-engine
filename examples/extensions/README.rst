Extension Examples
==================

Examples demonstrating extensions from the original BAM model
(Delli Gatti et al., 2011).

These examples reproduce research extensions from the BAM book:

* **Growth+ Model**: R&D investment and endogenous productivity growth
* **Consumption and Buffer Shock**: Household consumption shocks and savings buffer dynamics
* **Parameter Space Exploration**: Systematic exploration of model sensitivity to key parameters
* **Preferential Attachment**: Preferential attachment in consumption and firm entry mechanisms

Each example includes detailed explanations of the economic mechanisms and
comparison with results from the original literature.
